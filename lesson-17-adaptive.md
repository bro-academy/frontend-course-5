# Homework

**Implement a responsive layout for all pages:**
1. Homework Homepage<br /> 
Enable horizontal scroll for blocks:
- catalog items
- blog posts
- team members
Ensure the burger menu open and work correctly on mobile devices.
2. Homework Catalog page<br /> 
Ensure the filter panel open and work correctly on mobile devices.
3. Homework Blog post page
4. Homework Contact page

Avoid horizontal scroll on the entire page — make sure the layout fits the viewport properly.
Test your layout on different screen sizes and pay close attention to spacing, alignment, and interactions.

## Criteria 

❤️ **Responsive adaptive layout is implemented.**<br />
All pages should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. Layouts must reflow and resize content properly without breaking.<br />

❤️ **No horizontal scroll on the full page.**<br />
The main document (html and body) must not scroll sideways on any screen size. Overflow should be handled inside specific containers if needed.<br />

❤️ **Burger menu works on mobile.**<br />
The navigation menu must be hidden behind a burger icon on small screens, and it must open/close correctly with a tap.<br />

❤️ **Filter panel opens correctly on mobile.**<br />
If the page includes a filter section, it must be collapsible and function properly on smaller viewports.<br />

❤️ **Horizontal scroll is enabled for specific blocks.**<br />
On the homepage, sections indicated in the layout as scrollable (e.g., carousels, cards) should scroll horizontally on mobile only, without affecting the rest of the page.<br />

❤️ **Breakpoints are well chosen.**<br />
Use media queries that match real device sizes (not arbitrary pixels), and ensure content looks good across popular breakpoints (e.g., 360px, 678px, 1280px).<br />

❤️ **Consistent spacing and alignment.**<br />
Ensure padding/margins remain visually balanced across viewports. Avoid large gaps or tight overlaps on mobile.<br />

❤️ **Interactive elements are accessible on mobile.**<br />
Touch targets (buttons, links, toggles) should be large enough to tap easily, and key interactions (menu open/close, scrolling, filters) should feel smooth and intuitive.<br />
