# Homework

1. Add fonts using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Open file `style.css` and write basic styles for the marked-up blocks using Emmet.
      - font-*: font type / font weight / font size 
      - text properties: letter spacing / text align / text decoration / line height
      - text color
      - borders / border radius
      - list-style 
      - opacity  
      - background-color

3. Optional: Connect [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to your project as a separate file, use `<link>` tag in `<head>`.

## Criteria CSS

❤️ **Single CSS File** <br />
Use a single CSS file for all pages (style.css). <br />
Normalize.css should be included as an additional file. 

❤️ **All fonts used in the design are connected to the pages.** <br />
Preferably from Google Fonts. 

❤️ **Provide fallback fonts and family types at the end of the font list.** 
For example:  ```font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;``` 

❤️ **Do not use !important in CSS.** <br />

❤️ **Do not use #id for styling.** <br />

💛 **Include Normalize.css** <br />
https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/  <br />
Normalize.css should be linked before the main style file. 

💛 **Avoid nesting selectors more than two levels deep.**  <br />

💛 **Avoid styling tags directly** <br />
except for body, ul, a, img. <br />

💛 **Colors should be in a consistent format (hex or rgba).** <br />
Color notation is either in hex ```(#000)``` or rgba if there is transparency. <br />
Keywords are not used. <br />

## Additional homework:

1. Complete one of the courses to reinforce the theory:
   - [Scaler](https://www.scaler.com/topics/css/) modules 1-3. It takes about two hours to complete, a lot of theory without practice.
